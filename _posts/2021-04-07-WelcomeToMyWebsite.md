## Time To Party!!!
Hi y'all! Welcome to my website! Here I'll post all sorts of things but mostly this is going to be my dumping ground for all my Blender tutorials! I persevered through a great many hardships, trials and tribulations, to get this ugly thing up and y'all better appreciate it--no I'm kidding! ... about you needing to appreciate it.

## Oh right, you wanna know who I am!
Hi, yes, hello! My name is Nora and my entire personality revolves around how frustrated I am by bad tutorials! I'm on a long and personal quest to eradicate rambling, pointless, and insufficient tutorials from our mortal coil! <3
<br>
No but really, I like making smol easily referenced tutorials for all sorts of things! They're meant to be downloaded and saved or shoved into reference sheets or even stolen and reposted on nefarious instagram accounts. I'll be uploading them all here on my website but my twitter is usually where they'll end up first. Please follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HeyNoraNora) if you aren't already!

I also make mecha stuff! I'm a HUUUUUUGE mecha fan-girl so you'll be seeing a lot of robots from me too.

## Linkies~
My [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/heynoranora) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/heynoranora) work more like a tip jar, so if you like my stuff and want to make sure my attention stays on making them long enough to see more, you can throw me only whatever you can afford to! Pls don't throw around money that you don't have!
