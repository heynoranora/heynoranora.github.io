## Things I do

* Mecha
* Suggestive content (Revealing clothing, specific body types, etc)
* Almost Furry (sort-of)

## Things I don't do

* Character designs
* Very animalistic furries
* Testing in VR, as I do not own a VR set
* Painterly or Sketchy texturing--unless I'm directed to an instructor who will teach me

# Pricing

## For Human Avatars

* Original From-Scratch Body, Face, Hair & Outfit: $800 ~ $1500

## For Mecha Avatars

* Original From-Scratch: $600 ~ $1000

## For Low-Poly Avatars, Mascots, or Props

* Original From-Scratch: $200 ~ $800
* Vertex Colors instead of Textured (Think FFVII monsters): -$100 off final price.
* Prices may even be considerably lower depending on the project, do feel free to DM me if you're unsure!

## Other Services

* Want a unique rig that emulates anatomical deformations or other complex features: DM me
* Want a image/text tutorial for Blender or any other part of my process? Sure: DM me
* Want your avatar's face to have anime shading via vertex normals editing? I'm just an off-brand [Rukikuri](https://mobile.twitter.com/rukikuri): DM me.
* Want a custom animated Twitch Overlay to flex on your gamer(derogatory) friends? Why certainly: DM me
* Want me to frankenstein stuff to other stuff? Depends, but probably not: DM me anyway
* Anything else? Just DM me maybe, no harm in asking.

## Terms of Service & Rules

* I resepct NDAs, I'll stay hush-hush about your project, but the price may be risen slightly.
* Upfront payment of at least 50% of the full price must be payed before I begin modelling, and the other half upon completion. This is to avoid scams. Once the price is paid in full, I will send all of the agreed upon files asap. I don't accept payments weeks/months in advance before I am able to start.
* No "Child-Coded" characters for NSFW or adult purposes. I will get *mad* if I'm lied to about this.
* No re-selling under any circumstance, unless explicitely specified and agreed upon.
* I will send updates at milestones throughout the process, or upon request. But please respect boundaries, I'm only human.
* Revisions are welcome during each stage of the process, within reason. The earlier it's revised, the bigger changes I can make. No revision requests will be allowed beyond 1 week after final payment.
* I will follow references as close as I am comfortable with. The results will vary and may not be exactly as expected depending on the references given.
* Once I start the modelling process, I will not accept new references. Gather all the references needed before I begin, thank you.
* Please be reasonable with your expectations. Results may vary as some things may stretch my capabilities.
* (Temporary) Turn-around times may vary greatly and I will finish at my own pace. I am new to taking paid commissions and I cannot predict nor guarantee an accurate timeline yet. If you require a rush job, make that clear as early as possible. As of now, expect 4 weeks minimum.


# FAQ

## What will I get when I commission a model from you?

* A rigged 3D Model in fbx format, with corresponding texture files.
* A VRM model for use in Unity.
* The Blender file (.blend) it was made in.
* Standard Blendshapes for use with VSeeFace, VRChat, etc.
* (If requested) Dynamic bones for jiggle, hair, and clothing.
* A Rendered image of your posed completed model.
* Usage Rights of the 3D model and all its elements for public and private purposes.

## What will I NOT get?

* The Rights to sell the model and/or parts of it.
* Eternal youth.
* Breakfast in bed.

## I don't have neough money right now, but I will later. What should I do?

* Wait until you have the money before asking me. If you can't pay, I won't work.

## Why are your prices the way they are?

* Honestly, I value my time and I'm mad at artists who do model commissions for dirt cheap. 150 buckaroos for a custom model is highway robbery and they are devaluing *our* work. If I go any lower my time would be better spent flipping burgers.

## So what are the *actual* copyrights, ya know?

* My clients are granted a license to use, modify, and distribute my work so long as they credit me when asked, @HeyNoraNora, and do not sell it. If you want to own the copyright itself (including selling rights), be upfront and sign a contract, expect a higher price.

## Do you speak any languages other than English?

* I'm small brain and I can only understand English. I'll try my best to communicate effectively, either through machine translation or asking friends to translate for us, but I cannot guarantee things may work out.
